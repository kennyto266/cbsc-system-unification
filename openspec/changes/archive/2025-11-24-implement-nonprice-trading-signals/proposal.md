# Non-Price Data Technical Analysis Trading Signals Implementation

## Change Summary
Implement a production-ready trading signal system using the proven MB_KDJ_[10,2] strategy that achieved Sharpe ratio 3.672 with 121.62% annual returns based on Hong Kong government monetary base data.

## Problem Statement
The existing massive_nonprice_ta_optimizer.py has successfully identified a world-class trading strategy (MB_KDJ_[10,2] with Sharpe 3.672) but lacks a real-time signal generation and execution system that can be used for actual trading.

## Proposed Solution
Create a comprehensive non-price data trading signal system that:
1. Generates real-time buy/sell signals based on monetary base data and KDJ indicators
2. Provides configurable risk management and position sizing
3. Supports multiple stocks with individual signal processing
4. Integrates with existing data sources and trading infrastructure

## Capabilities
- Real-time Signal Generation
- Multi-Stock Portfolio Management
- Risk Management Controls
- Performance Monitoring
- Alert System Integration

## Technical Requirements
- Use existing MB_KDJ_[10,2] proven strategy
- Integrate with real HK government data sources
- Provide 3% risk-free rate Sharpe calculation
- Support both backtesting and live trading modes

## Success Criteria
- Reproduce Sharpe > 3.0 performance in backtesting
- Generate timely and accurate trading signals
- Maintain < 10% maximum drawdown as proven
- Support real-time execution with minimal latency
